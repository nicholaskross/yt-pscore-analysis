# YouTube P-Score Analysis
The following are some thoughts I had while analyzing the YouTube P-Score dataset compiled by Bowblax, Nicholars DeOrio, Optimus, and Pescatore.

Original dataset: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/130CDsPSjg2BzzlA476AxjZQDdGiHGejhwV_F1H99RMs/edit
Original writeup of the dataset: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xyxDZIGztWDqGQGae4Oakkt0VAYB21-OcXgNKYrPzcw/edit

My cleaned-up, extended, and modified version of the dataset: In this repo, as "modded P-ScoreList.xlsx"
